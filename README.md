## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/wRlpwQHc/groovn-music)

[Product Canvas]()

What is GroovnMusic?

CONTENT 1

CONTENT 2


### Key Features

-    Ability for the user to generate a recommended playlist based by "Liked" songs
-    User-friendly, ease of navigation
-    Millions of songs to explore

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React | React Hooks / Context | Passport.js and OAuth 

Why did you choose this framework?

-    We decided to utilize React and React Hooks library because of the power it can provide to our product.  Utilizing the Hooks concpt by neglecting the use of writing a class was time-saving.  
-    Deviding to use React Context was a simple and smart decision by our team mainly because of it being a big part of the React library.  It gave us the ability to pass data through a component with ease.  A great way to stream line writing code.

-    point four

List the rest of the front end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above.

#### Front end deployed to `http://groovn-frontend-prod.netlify.com/`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/groovn-music-be) built using:

####

-    Apollo GraphQL - writing queries, combining APIs and databases
-    Node.js - JS runtime environent
-    Express - web framework for Node.js
-    MongoDB - database 
-    Mongoose - query building and schema

# APIs

## Spotify API 

We decided to use the Spotify API mainly for build time and production.  We wanted our users to have the ability to create a playlist and play their music.  By using Spotify's API, it's based on REST principles and the endpoints return JSON metadata about music artists, albums, and tracks, directly from the Spotify Data Catalogue.  It also provides access to user related data, like playlists and music that the user saves in their music library.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products

# 5️⃣ Content Licenses

🚫For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |

# 4️⃣ Testing

🚫Document what you used for testing and why

# 4️⃣ Installation Instructions

🚫explain how to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn and NPM

## Other Scripts

🚫replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
